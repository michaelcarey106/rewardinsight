Hi Patrick

This is my solution to your tech challenge.

The scripts I have included do not point to a specific user or remote host. This is becasue i was unsure if you would have your own speicif remote hosts you want to test them on.

If this is not the case. I have been testing these on my own azure hosted ubuntu VM's which you can use.

Please let me know and I can spin them up for you and supply the details of what would be the created developer user. This is detailed in the assumptions in the docuemnt titled 'michael carey solution'

Thanks and hope you enjoy.
